We have a dataset with the **consumption of alcohol** in the world by country. (Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/sveneschlbeck/alcohol-consumption-per-capita-year-and-country)
I would like to check:
1) changes of consumption in the world (countries grouping by income) over the years and prediction for 20, 30, 50 years from 2000;
2) clustering of countries.
